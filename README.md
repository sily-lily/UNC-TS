# 🖥️ UNC-TS

Roblox-TS typings for scripting engines following [UNC standards](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard) and common nonstandard APIs.

Remember to focus on compatibility! Functions can be missing in some environments, but this will not be reflected in types, so be mindful of what you use.
